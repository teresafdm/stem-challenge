The project was initiated by Code First Girls in the Intro to Interactive Websites Challenge. The challenge was to create a website that would attract young people and parents to develop their knowledge in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Maths) and signpost to other organisations or sources of information. In two weeks our international team of four built a fun and engaging website using HTML, CSS (+ Bootstrap), JavaScript, and open trivia API.
