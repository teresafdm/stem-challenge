    <h3 class="info">Rosalind Franklin</h3>
            <p>An English chemist and X-ray crystallographer, Franklin's work was crucial in the discovery of the DNA double helix structure. Her X-ray diffraction images of DNA provided vital insights that were used by James Watson and Francis Crick in their model-building efforts. </p>

            <p>Additionally, Franklin's research on the tobacco mosaic virus and her work in the field of coal and carbon research were also significant. Unfortunately, her contributions were not fully recognized during her lifetime, and her early death at the age of 37 further limited her recognition. However, her work has since gained proper acknowledgment, highlighting her critical role in advancing our understanding of molecular biology and genetics.</p>

    	<p>She developed the first successful treatment for those with Hansen‚Äôs disease (leprosy). It was an injectable oil extract & was the most effective treatment for leprosy until the 1940s.</p>

    	<p>Ball's work marked a significant advancement in medical science and offered hope to individuals suffering from this debilitating disease. Tragically, she passed away at a young age, but her contributions have had a lasting impact on the field of medicine. It's important to remember her contributions and the way she overcame barriers to make a difference in the lives of others.</p>

            <p>mathematician and physicist, Johnson played a pivotal role in the early space programs of the United States. She calculated trajectories, launch windows, and return paths for various space missions at NASA, including the Mercury and Apollo missions.</p>
            <p>Johnson's calculations were crucial for ensuring the success and safety of spaceflights. She overcame racial and gender barriers to become an integral part of the team that helped the U.S. achieve milestones in space exploration. Her story was brought to wider attention through the book and movie "Hidden Figures," shedding light on her essential contributions to science and space exploration.</p>
